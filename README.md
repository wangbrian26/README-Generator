Then, users will be prompted to allocate 50 stats points to their selected stats and given a list of rules for the upcoming pokemon battle. Users will then see the battle take place between their fan created pokemon and a random fusion pokemon. Users will then battle to see how many fusion pokemon they can defeat.
